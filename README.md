# About

Live demo here: https://quantscientist.github.io/ncnnRay/

**ncnnRay++** is a CMake based **integration** of **_raylib_** (https://www.raylib.com/examples.html) and the very popular 
ncnn (https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn) Deep Learning library. ncnn is written in C++ designed (but not only) for edge computing devices. 
The project depends on **the Vulkan** SDK (Vulakn is Khronos' API for Graphics and Compute on GPUs).
 
**There is no OpenCV dependency for reading and writing images / videos or anything else**. Everything is self-contained 
using stb_image . The library includes conversion utils between ray Image, `ncnn::Mat` and PNG lib, all of which are interchangeable.
For more details, refer to: 
- https://github.com/QuantScientist/ncnnRay/blob/master/include/utils/vision_utils.hpp

**Why??++** The goal is to integrate both libraries into HTML using Webassembly. ray is already natively supported on WASM. 
This would open the door to countless opportunities in creativity.

# Available AI Models (Tencent ncnn in C++)
 Most of the models were originally trained in **PyTorch**, then converted to **onnx** and then to **ncnn**.

# GPU or CPU?  
If you want to test on a CPU you will have to edit the CMakeLists file. ncnn uses the Vulkan SDK for all its GPU operations. 

GPU (Vulkan) mode:
```cmake
set(NCNN_DEVICE "VULKAN")
```
CPU mode: 
```cmake
set(NCNN_DEVICE "cpu")
```
**Note**: Tested only on **GPU with CUDA 10.2 and a CPU on a Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18 machines**. 

## Vulkan
Vulkan is Khronos' API for High-efficiency Graphics and Compute on GPUs. 

In analogy to PyTorch which uses CUDA behind the scenes to allocate tensors on a GPU, ncnn uses the Vulkan SDK and shaders to do the same. 
**To use Vulkan backend** during CMake build, install Vulkan header files, a vulkan driver loader, GLSL to SPIR-V 
compiler and vulkaninfo tool. Preferably from your distribution repositories. Alternatively download and install full Vulkan SDK 
(about 200MB in size; it contains all header files, documentation and prebuilt loader, 
as well some extra tools and source code of everything) from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home

**To use Vulkan after building ncnn**  you will also need to have Vulkan driver for your GPU. 
For AMD and Intel GPUs these can be found in Mesa graphics driver, which usually is installed by default on 
all distros. 
For Nvidia GPUs the propietary Nvidia driver must be downloaded and installed 
After installing Vulkan driver, confirm Vulkan libraries and driver are working, 
by using vulkaninfo it should list GPU device type. For instance:
````bash
VkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties:
---------------------------------
driverID           = DRIVER_ID_NVIDIA_PROPRIETARY
driverName         = NVIDIA
driverInfo         = 452.28
conformanceVersion = 1.2.3.1
```` 
 

## RayLib 
rayLib is an amazing library which has been widely adopted by the gaming community. 
Read more about the raylib game framework here: https://www.raylib.com/
Or look up projects using it here:
https://www.google.com/search?q=raylib+site:github.com   

## Tencent ncnn 
Written in C++, ncnn has a community that is growing by the day. It compiles on almost every platform and is 
mainly targeted at egde devices. https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn   
  
  
<p align="right">
<sub>(Preview)</sub>
</p>

## A simple example 
The folowing example create a ray window, allocates a `ncnn::Mat` on the GPU and draws the value  into a ray window. 
 
```cpp

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    Image image = LoadImage("faces.png");   // Loaded in CPU memory (RAM)
    ncnn::Mat inmat = rayImageToNcnn(image);
    std::cout << "Total:" << inmat.total() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "D:" << tensorDIMS(inmat) << std::endl;;
    Image saveImage = ncnnToRayImage(inmat);
    ExportImage(saveImage, "faces-ncnn-rgb.png");

    Image imageRGBA = LoadImage("manga.png");   // Loaded in CPU memory (RAM)
    ncnn::Mat inmatimageRGBA = rayImageToNcnn(imageRGBA);
    std::cout << "Total:" << inmatimageRGBA.total() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "D:" << tensorDIMS(inmatimageRGBA) << std::endl;;
    Image saveImageimageRGBA = ncnnToRayImage(inmatimageRGBA);
    ExportImage(saveImageimageRGBA, "manga-ncnn-rgba.png");    

    return 0;
```

## Requirements:
* Tested only on Windows 10 and Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 16.4
* Vulkan SDK  
* ncnn  (downloaded automatically)  
* Tested on 64 bit only device.  
* CMake 3.18

# Building using CMake

Start by:
```bash
git clone --recurssive https://github.com/QuantScientist/ncnnRay.git
```

## ncnn 
**CMake** should take care of everything for you!   
````bash
cd to 3rdparty\ncnn\
git submodule update --init
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
cmake.exe -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "CodeBlocks - NMake Makefiles" . 
-B bin64 -DNCNN_VULKAN=ON -DNCNN_SYSTEM_GLSLANG=ON -DNCNN_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DNCNN_BENCHMARK=ON 
-DNCNN_BUILD_TOOLS=ON  && cmake.exe --build bin64
````
CLion is strongly recommended for the build.  
   
Then cd to the root folder of the project and run again:
````bash
cd to the root folder
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
cmake.exe -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "CodeBlocks - NMake Makefiles" . 
-B bin64 -DNCNN_VULKAN=ON -DNCNN_SYSTEM_GLSLANG=ON -DNCNN_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DNCNN_BENCHMARK=ON 
-DNCNN_BUILD_TOOLS=ON  && cmake.exe --build bin64
````
## Downloading and installing steps rayLib:
The **CMake file will download this automatically for you**.

# Compiling on Windows

````bash
standalone.bat 
````
# Compiling on Linux

Please use the provided **docker** that includes everything you need including Emscripten / emsdk. 
````bash
git submodule update --init
